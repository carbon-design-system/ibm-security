To install Carbon for IBM Security in your project, you'll need to run one of the following commands using a package manager:

```bash
# npm - https://www.npmjs.com
npm i -S @carbon/ibm-security

# Yarn - https://yarnpkg.com
yarn add @carbon/ibm-security
```

### Distribution tags

Please use [distribution tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) to install the most relevant version of this framework. e.g. `npm i -S @carbon/ibm-security@latest`:

- `@latest` - Stable
- `@canary` - Prerelease
- `@next` - Alpha

### React

All components come with any installation of Carbon for IBM Security. You can use them by doing the following in your project:

```js
// ES Modules - https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules
import { ComponentName } from '@carbon/ibm-security';

// CommonJS - http://www.commonjs.org
const { ComponentName } = require('@carbon/ibm-security');
```

[Babel](https://babeljs.io) builds both of these variants and imports `carbon-components-react` in the respective version using a [plugin](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-security/blob/master/babel/carbon-components-react-import.babel-plugin.js), so that no further transpilation is required.

### SCSS

To add a component style to your build, import the component directly. Importing a component this way will bring in any dependencies that component has as well. The import system removes duplicate dependencies, so shared dependencies between components will not create extra CSS.

```scss
@import '@carbon/ibm-security/scss/components/ComponentName/index';
```

To add all of the components' styles, import the entry point:

```scss
@import '@carbon/ibm-security/scss/index';
```

### CSS

To add all of the components' processed and minified styles, reference `@carbon/ibm-security/css/index.min.css`.
