| [`@carbon/icons-react`](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/icons-react) | Iconography assets                                 |

To install Carbon for IBM Security in your project, you'll need to run one of the following commands using a package manager:

```bash
# npm - https://www.npmjs.com
npm i -S @carbon/ibm-security

# Yarn - https://yarnpkg.com
yarn add @carbon/ibm-security
```

### Distribution tags

Please use [distribution tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) to install the most relevant version of this framework. e.g. `npm i -S @carbon/ibm-security@latest`:

- `@latest` - Stable
- `@canary` - Prerelease
- `@next` - Alpha

### React

All components come with any installation of Carbon for IBM Security. You can use them by doing the following in your project:

```js
// ES Modules - https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules
import { ComponentName } from '@carbon/ibm-security';

// CommonJS - http://www.commonjs.org
const { ComponentName } = require('@carbon/ibm-security');
```

[Babel](https://babeljs.io) builds both of these variants and imports `carbon-components-react` in the respective version using a [plugin](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-security/blob/master/babel/carbon-imports.babel-plugin.js), so that no further transpilation is required.

### SCSS

To add a component style to your build, import the component directly. Importing a component this way will bring in any dependencies that component has as well. The import system removes duplicate dependencies, so shared dependencies between components will not create extra CSS.

In addition, to resolve your `@import` declarations, you will need to setup `node-sass` so that `node_modules` is included in the [`includePaths`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths) option.

```scss
@import '@carbon/ibm-security/scss/components/ComponentName/index';
```

To add all of the components' styles, import the entry point:

```scss
@import '@carbon/ibm-security/scss/index';
```

#### Feature flags

Carbon for IBM Security takes advantage of feature flags to conditionally enable or disable features. To configure feature flags, you will need to update the `$security--feature-flags` map before importing any Sass files. For example:

```scss
$security--feature-flags: (
  ibm-type: false,
);

@import '@carbon/ibm-security/scss/index';
```

### CSS

To add all of the components' processed and minified styles, reference `@carbon/ibm-security/css/index.min.css`.
