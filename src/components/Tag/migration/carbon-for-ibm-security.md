# `Tag`

Declaring this component as selected (`isSelected`) and removable (`removable`) has been deprecated - please use the `InteractiveTag` component instead.

Also refer to [migration in Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/react/src/components/Tag/migrate-to-7.x.md).

## Example

```js
<InteractiveTag isSelected removable>
  InteractiveTag
</Tag>
```
