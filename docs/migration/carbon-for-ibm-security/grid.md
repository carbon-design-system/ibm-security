# Grid

The existing grid specification will be deprecated in the next major version in favor of [Carbon's grid](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/grid#usage).

Also refer to [migration in Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/docs/migration/10.x-grid.md).
