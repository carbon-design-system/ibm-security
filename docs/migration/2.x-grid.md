# Grid

The existing grid specification will be deprecated in the next major version in favor of [Carbon's grid](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-elements/tree/master/packages/grid#usage).

Also refer to [migration in Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/docs/migration/10.x-grid.md).

## Migrating

| `1.x`                          | `2.x`                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@import '@ibmduo/grid/**/*';` | `@import '@carbon/ibm-security/scss/globals/grid/index';` |

If using `@carbon/grid`, you can disable the legacy grid output using a feature flag by writing the following Sass code before importing:

```scss
$security--feature-flags: (
  css-gridish: false,
);
```
