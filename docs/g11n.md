# Notes on globalization

- Some components, such as `DataDecorator` support a `labels` prop that provide the ability to pass an object allowing the default strings of the component to be overwritten - A [global configuration](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-security/blob/master/src/globals/nls.js) is available that outlines support for overriding default component options
- Also refer to [g11n considerations in Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/react/docs/g11n.md)
